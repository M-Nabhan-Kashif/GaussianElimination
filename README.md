# Gaussian Elimination Matrix Calculator

This Java program performs **Gaussian Elimination** on user-defined or randomly generated matrices to reduce them to row echelon form. Developed as a midterm project for *M 340L: Matrices and Matrix Calculations* at the University of Texas at Austin.

## Features

- Interactive CLI for inputting custom matrices
- Partial pivoting for numerical stability
- Formatted matrix output with configurable precision
- Built-in performance and complexity tests (FLOPs and runtime analysis)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gaussian-elimination-calculator.git
   ```
2. Compile and run the program:
   ```bash
   javac Matrix.java
   java Matrix
   ```
